# SCP (Street Programmer Community)

Hello Punk! We are street programmer that work out of the box in everyway of traditional theory and we're not calling snippet of code but called as Metaphor.

Basically programming language is a bridge to communicate with other people in the world without speak in their national language, we can collaborate each other without knowing our national language.

We called our member Punk/Freestyler/Software Freestyle Engineer that create some Metaphor to make this world more better.
