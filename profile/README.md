# SCP (Street Programmer Community)

Hello Punk! We are street programmer that work out of the box in everyway of traditional theory and we're not calling snippet of code but called as Metaphor.

We know that programming is more than just code. It's an art form, and like all art, it's open to interpretation. That's why we've created a space for metaphor stories in each programming language. Each story is a unique interpretation of programming in a particular language, and it's a great way to expand your thinking and learn new skills. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting, our stories will inspire and challenge you to think outside the box.

We called our member **Punk/Freestyler/Software Freestyle Engineer** that create some Metaphor to make this world more better.
